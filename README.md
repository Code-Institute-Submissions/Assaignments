Intro

My Project is about the Amur Leopard. The amur leopard is one of the most endangered species in the world, and as such requires
protectio for it to survive. And as such I have created a website to get sponsorship to help the Leopard.
I have described the Leopard, whilst also trying to persuade people to regiset and predominantly adopt a leopard. 
The user can also understand where the funds are going whilst having an enjoyable experience using the website

UX

The UX of the website is designed to cater to all users; Ipad Phone and PC users. By doing this I can maximse the donations I can 
receive from custoers, which is the main purpost of the website. There are many images in the webpage, which helps to deliver emotive
feeling that can persuade people to sign up. 

wireframe

For this project I used a wireframe to help build up an idea of what I was going to crate this can be seen here "https://www.figma.com/file/TCIY2lrHYKOjHoMuWlofXV/Code-Project?node-id=5%3A75"

Features

The feature I have implemented include:

A sign up form for the user, where they can build an account with us to receive updates and help them come back to the website
A adoption sign up page to descrive the packages available and persuade them to sign up in the long-term

A feature I am looking to implement in the future is a progress tracker so the user can see how close we are to reaching our goals

Language used

I have used Bootstrap, css, and Html to create this webpage, Bootstrao has helped to make the pages completely user friendly no 
matter the size of the display being used. 

I have used Wikipedia mainly for the factual information regarding the Amur Leopard, such as locaton etc.
Google Images have been used in the webpage which has helped to deliver great illustrations to the site, but not included copyrighted material
WWF.org.uk has been a big inspiration in creating the webpage, it has helped to give a heading and and idea on how to be more
persuasive with the imagery and the text


Deployment
I have depoyed my code onto GitHub for viewing/testing
